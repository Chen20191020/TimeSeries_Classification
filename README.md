# Classification Method for Locally Stationary Time Series

This repository contains demonstration code for the TimeSeries_Classification project. It includes complete implementations of both simulation studies and real-data experiments used 



Our proposed method is described in the paper:
C. Qian, X. Ding, and L. Li. Structural Classification of Locally Stationary Time Series Based on Second-order Characteristics, arXiv: 2507.04237. https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04237

# How to use 
To run the proposed method, first run file Fast_Proposed_method.R. In order to run FLogistic method, first install the package "FREG" using FREG file. For Table 1, first run the file Simulation_setup_eps1.R. For Table S.1, first run the file Simulation_setup_eps2.R. For Table S.2, first run the file Simulation_setup_eps3.R. 

For Table S.3. The Simulation Data used for methods in Python can be download from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J1zWdC41zoJ_QWxubKw-0LUxeZavRYmu?usp=sharing, the path of file should manually input in. For the method in R, first run file SimulationLSW_setup.R.
